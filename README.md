# GeSSA
GeSSA (Goldeneye Speedrun Sidebar Assistant) is an OBS browser element that displays level data and your times to your viewers. The sidebar is intergated into the app (the controller) and can be configured to your needs.

The project is closed source as of now.

# The terms for using GeSSA
### General
GeSSA (The "Controller" and "Sidebar") will require access to your AppData folder and will ONLY USE ITS PERSONAL FOLDER to create, edit and delete your settings and level data files that the controller application uses. GeSSA will not alter any other files within your device.

GeSSA does not require internet access with the exception of the font styles being sourced from Google Fonts. The network access used on the local machine is for that machine only, and GeSSA cannot be accessed through your network locally or world wide.

GeSSA will download updates automatically and cannot be averted. They are mandatory. You will be able to delay updates, if you select the option to, for the session, until you close the GeSSA application. The default option to restart and install the updates automatically is "on". Updates will be downloaded and installed automatically when you load GeSSA, regardless of your settings.

### Tampering
GeSSA complies with the Computer Misuse Act 1990, meaning that the application is not made for malicious purposes or to access data in an unauthorised way.

You will not tamper with, modify, add or remove any code that GeSSA or the sidebar uses to change how either product functions. If you do, you will potentially cause damage to the application, your personal files, system files and/or machine entirely.
