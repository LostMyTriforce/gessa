# GeSSA
GeSSA (Goldeneye Speedrun Sidebar Assistant) is an OBS browser element that displays level data and your times to your viewers. The sidebar is intergated into the app (the controller) and can be configured to your needs.

The project is closed source as of now.

**You need the font "Agency FB" in order to use GeSSA properly.**

# The terms for using GeSSA
_The ammended terms will come into effect upon the release of Build 60._
### General
GeSSA (The "Controller" and "Sidebar") will require access to your AppData folder and will ONLY USE ITS PERSONAL FOLDER to create, edit and delete your settings and level data files that the controller application uses. GeSSA will not alter any other files within your device.

GeSSA does not require internet access with the exception of the font styles being sourced from Google Fonts. The network access used on the local machine is for that machine only, and GeSSA cannot be accessed through your network locally or world wide.

GeSSA will download updates automatically and cannot be averted. They are mandatory. You will be able to delay updates, if you select the option to, for the session, until you close the GeSSA application. The default option to restart and install the updates automatically is "on". Updates will be downloaded and installed automatically when you load GeSSA, regardless of your settings.

### Diagnostic Data
GeSSA's controller, if you accept to allow diagnostic data, will create an anonymous log of your system configuration and what you do in GeSSA. The default option for diagnostic data is set to "off".

The diagnostic data will include; the OS you are using, the amount of memory you have, what settings you have applied in GeSSA, what is loaded and saved to, and from, your database, what settings you turn off and on in your session, and, any unhandled and handled exceptions that occur.

You can send this diagnostic data to Zwonkous (The "creator"), so they have better understanding of when an error occurs, and any updates can be released to all users in a timely manner.

All users, regardless of their settings, can view, and delete their diagnostic data at any time, but will not be able to edit it. This only applies if the user has; turned on diagnostic data before, and, have not performed a "fresh start" before then.

### Tampering
GeSSA complies with the Computer Misuse Act 1990, meaning that the application is not made for malicious purposes or to access data in an unauthorised way.

You will not tamper with, modify, add or remove any code that GeSSA or the sidebar uses to change how either product functions. If you do, you will potentially cause damage to the application, your personal files, system files and/or machine entirely. You will be responsible for any negligent actions you cause to your system and/or files.

The creator, will not give assistance to any tampered GeSSA application.
